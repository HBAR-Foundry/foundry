HBAR Foundry (“HF”) Charter

Effective Jul 31 2023 / Updated Oct 13 2023

#### 1. Mission of the HBAR Foundry.

The HBAR Foundry’s mission is to unite Hedera ecosystem stakeholders, promote Hedera-related tech adoption, and foster collaboration, establishing Hedera as a global leader on Distributed Ledger Technology.

Hedera is a decentralized, open-source, proof-of-stake public ledger that utilizes the leaderless, asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) hashgraph consensus algorithm. It is governed by a collusion-resistant, decentralized council of leading enterprises and universities from around the world.

#### 2. Role of the HBAR Foundry.

The HBAR Foundry is the voice of the Hedera builder community, bringing together end-users, business owners, developers, marketing experts, and HBAR holders. Our roles include guiding the development of standards, evaluating and promoting projects, facilitating communication, and providing practical support through mentorship, education, and effective tools for everyone in the Hedera ecosystem.

-	(a) Standards

	-	i. Promoting Interoperability: Communities that actively contribute to technology standards help ensure interoperability between different software and systems. When projects adhere to common standards, they can seamlessly work together, reducing compatibility issues and fostering a more cohesive and integrated technology landscape. This, in turn, encourages collaboration and sharing of resources among developers and stakeholders, leading to accelerated innovation and problem-solving.

	-	ii. Enabling Community-driven Innovation: By contributing to technology standards, open source communities can influence the direction and evolution of the technology itself. Standards that are developed collaboratively and openly can reflect a wider range of perspectives and use cases. As a result, the technology becomes more robust, adaptable, and relevant to the needs of the community it serves. This democratization of standards development encourages creativity and empowers developers to build upon shared foundations, leading to a thriving ecosystem of innovative solutions.

-	(b) Evaluating and Promoting Projects

	-	i. Driving Quality Assurance: As communities are often composed of passionate and knowledgeable individuals, their involvement in vetting projects ensures a higher standard of quality. By rigorously evaluating projects for code integrity, security, and adherence to best practices, they help identify potential issues early on, reducing the risk of faulty or subpar software entering the ecosystem. This commitment to quality assurance strengthens the overall reputation of the community and the projects associated with it.

	-	ii. Maintaining Trust and Reputation: Communities are built on trust, transparency, and collaboration. When they actively participate in vetting projects, it signals to users and stakeholders that the community takes its responsibility seriously. By promoting only well-vetted and reputable projects, the community can instill confidence in users and investors, leading to increased adoption and support for the ecosystem. Additionally, a strong reputation for vetting projects can attract more contributors and developers, enriching the talent pool and fostering a positive feedback loop of trust and growth.

-	(c) Communication

	-	i. Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing: In an open source ecosystem, collaboration is essential for the success and improvement of projects. By facilitating communication among community members, developers can exchange ideas, share knowledge, and collectively solve challenges. Open and effective communication channels foster a culture of learning and mentorship, allowing newcomers to gain insights from experienced contributors. This collaborative environment enhances the overall expertise within the community and leads to more innovative and robust solutions.

	-	ii. Community Building and Engagement: Communication is the lifeblood of any community. By actively facilitating communication, an open source community strengthens its bonds, builds a sense of camaraderie, and nurtures a vibrant social fabric. Regular interactions, discussions, and updates help community members feel more engaged and valued, which, in turn, increases their commitment to the projects and the community as a whole. A thriving and engaged community attracts new contributors and supporters, ensuring the sustainability and growth of the ecosystem. Effective communication also allows the community to quickly respond to emerging issues, address concerns, and make collective decisions in a transparent and inclusive manner.

-	(d) Tools

	-	i. Empowering User Adoption and Contribution: Creating and maintaining a comprehensive set of libraries, tools, documentation, and SDKs enhances the accessibility and usability of open source projects. When these resources are readily available, developers and end-users can more easily adopt the Hedera and integrate it into their own projects. The provision of clear and extensive documentation also lowers the barriers for new contributors to join the community. As more users and contributors engage with the Hedera, it benefits from diverse perspectives, feedback, and contributions, leading to continuous improvement and innovation.

	-	ii. Nurturing Ecosystem Growth and Interoperability: Communities thrive on collaboration and the ability to work together effectively. By developing standardized libraries, tools, and SDKs, the community promotes consistency and interoperability among different projects. This uniformity streamlines integration processes, encouraging cross-collaboration and the creation of complementary tools. When diverse projects can seamlessly interact and build upon each other's work, it leads to a rich and interconnected ecosystem. Additionally, the availability of well-documented and well-maintained resources attracts developers and organizations to adopt the technology, further contributing to the ecosystem's growth and sustainability.

#### 3. Values.
